docs: add Logging & Debugging section to READMEs

Added comprehensive logging documentation to both adapter READMEs including:

- Quick start example with `createConsoleLogger`
- Environment variable pattern for easy toggling
- Log levels reference table
- Link to full logging documentation

This improves discoverability for developers who look at the README first.
