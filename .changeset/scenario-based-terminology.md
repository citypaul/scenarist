docs: clarify scenario-based testing terminology

- Add clear definition of "scenario-based testing" to distinguish from true E2E tests
- Update terminology from "E2E tests" to "scenario-based tests" where appropriate
- Remove internal testing documentation from package READMEs (consumer-focused)
- Add prominent documentation links to scenarist.io
