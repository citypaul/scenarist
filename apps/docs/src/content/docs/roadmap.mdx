Scenarist is evolving based on community needs. This page outlines planned features we're considering. **We're waiting for community feedback before building these**—if something here would help your workflow, let us know!

<Aside type="tip" title="Help shape the roadmap">
  Your input matters. Open an issue or discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/citypaul/scenarist/discussions) to share your thoughts on these features or suggest new ones.

## Scenarist DevTools

**Status:** Planned — awaiting community feedback

We're exploring a browser-based developer tool for scenario management, similar in spirit to [React Query DevTools](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/devtools) or [Redux DevTools](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#redux-devtools)—but framework-agnostic.

### The Vision

A floating panel in your browser that lets you:

- **See active scenario** — Know exactly which scenario is active for the current session
- **Switch scenarios instantly** — Click to change scenarios without touching code or restarting the server
- **Browse available scenarios** — See all registered scenarios with their descriptions
- **Explore scenario details** — Inspect what each scenario mocks before switching to it

```

### Use Cases

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Local Development" icon="laptop">
    Quickly explore different application states while developing. See how your UI handles premium users, error states, or edge cases without mocking code changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stakeholder Demos" icon="seti:video">
    Product owners and stakeholders can explore different scenarios during demos. "Let me show you the premium user experience" — click, done.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design Reviews" icon="pencil">
    Designers can see how their work looks with different data states. Empty states, error states, loading states — all accessible without code.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Key Design Principles

**Framework-Agnostic**
Unlike React-specific devtools, Scenarist DevTools would work with any framework—React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Solid, or vanilla JavaScript. The tool communicates with your Scenarist server, not with framework internals.

**Non-Production by Default**
The DevTools would only be available in development and testing environments. Your production bundle stays clean with zero overhead. Optionally, you could enable it in staging environments for stakeholder demos.

**Simple Integration**
A single script tag or import—that's it. No complex configuration. The tool discovers your scenarios automatically from the server.

### Tell Us What You Need

Before we build this, we want to hear from you:

- Would this tool help your workflow?
- What features are most important to you?
- Would you use it primarily for development, testing, or demos?
- What frameworks are you using?

## Additional Framework Adapters

**Status:** Planned — prioritized by community demand

Scenarist currently supports **Express** and **Next.js** (App Router and Pages Router). We're planning adapters for additional frameworks to bring scenario-based testing to more ecosystems.

### Planned Adapters

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SvelteKit" icon="seti:svelte">
    Full support for SvelteKit's server-side rendering and API routes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Angular" icon="seti:angular">
    Adapter for Angular Universal and Angular SSR applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Solid Start" icon="seti:javascript">
    Support for Solid's meta-framework with SSR and API routes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Remix" icon="seti:react">
    Adapter for Remix loaders and actions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Nuxt" icon="seti:vue">
    Support for Nuxt's server routes and SSR.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hono" icon="seti:typescript">
    Lightweight adapter for Hono's multi-runtime framework.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Prioritization

We'll prioritize adapters based on community demand. If you're using a framework not listed here, or want to see a specific adapter prioritized, let us know!

## Current Capabilities

While we work on future features, Scenarist already provides:

- **Test ID isolation** — Parallel tests with different scenarios
- **Runtime switching** — Change scenarios mid-test
- **First-class Playwright fixtures** — Type-safe scenario management
- **Response sequences** — Polling, retry flows, state machines
- **Stateful mocks** — Capture and inject request data
- **Advanced matching** — Body, headers, query, regex patterns
- **Production safety** — Zero overhead in production bundles
