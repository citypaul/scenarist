Scenarist is evolving based on community needs. This page outlines planned features we're considering. **We're waiting for community feedback before building these**—if something here would help your workflow, let us know!

<Aside type="tip" title="Help shape the roadmap">
  Your input matters. Open an issue or discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/citypaul/scenarist/discussions) to share your thoughts on these features or suggest new ones.

## Scenarist DevTools

**Status:** Planned — awaiting community feedback

We're exploring a browser-based developer tool for scenario management. Think [React Query DevTools](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/devtools)—a floating panel that lets you inspect and control state—but for scenarios, and framework-agnostic (not React-specific).

### The Vision

A floating panel in your browser that lets you:

- **See active scenario** — Know exactly which scenario is active for the current session
- **Switch scenarios instantly** — Click to change scenarios without touching code or restarting the server
- **Browse available scenarios** — See all registered scenarios with their descriptions
- **Explore scenario details** — Inspect what each scenario mocks before switching to it

```

### Use Cases

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Local Development" icon="laptop">
    Quickly explore different application states while developing. See how your UI handles premium users, error states, or edge cases without mocking code changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stakeholder Demos" icon="seti:video">
    Product owners and stakeholders can explore different scenarios during demos. "Let me show you the premium user experience" — click, done.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design Reviews" icon="pencil">
    Designers can see how their work looks with different data states. Empty states, error states, loading states — all accessible without code.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Key Design Principles

**Framework-Agnostic**
Unlike React-specific devtools, Scenarist DevTools would work with any framework—React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Solid, or vanilla JavaScript. The tool communicates with your Scenarist server, not with framework internals.

**Non-Production by Default**
The DevTools would only be available in development and testing environments. Your production bundle stays clean with zero overhead. Optionally, you could enable it in staging environments for stakeholder demos.

**Simple Integration**
A single script tag or import—that's it. No complex configuration. The tool discovers your scenarios automatically from the server.

### Tell Us What You Need

Before we build this, we want to hear from you:

- Would this tool help your workflow?
- What features are most important to you?
- Would you use it primarily for development, testing, or demos?
- What frameworks are you using?

## Additional Framework Adapters

**Status:** Planned — prioritized by community demand

Scenarist currently supports **Express** and **Next.js** (App Router and Pages Router). We're planning adapters for additional frameworks to bring scenario-based testing to more ecosystems.

### Planned Adapters

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SvelteKit" icon="seti:svelte">
    Full support for SvelteKit's server-side rendering and API routes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Angular" icon="seti:angular">
    Adapter for Angular Universal and Angular SSR applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Solid Start" icon="seti:javascript">
    Support for Solid's meta-framework with SSR and API routes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Remix" icon="seti:react">
    Adapter for Remix loaders and actions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Nuxt" icon="seti:vue">
    Support for Nuxt's server routes and SSR.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hono" icon="seti:typescript">
    Lightweight adapter for Hono's multi-runtime framework.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Prioritization

We'll prioritize adapters based on community demand. If you're using a framework not listed here, or want to see a specific adapter prioritized, let us know!

## Cypress Helpers

**Status:** Planned — awaiting community feedback

Scenarist currently provides [first-class Playwright fixtures](/testing/playwright-integration) with type-safe scenario switching and automatic test ID handling. We're planning equivalent support for Cypress.

### What Cypress Helpers Would Provide

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Type-Safe Scenarios" icon="seti:typescript">
    Autocomplete for scenario IDs, compile-time validation, and full TypeScript support—just like our Playwright fixtures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic Test Isolation" icon="random">
    Each Cypress test gets a unique test ID. Run tests in parallel with different scenarios, no conflicts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Commands" icon="seti:powershell">
    `cy.switchScenario('premium-user')` — simple, readable commands that handle all the HTTP plumbing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intercept Integration" icon="forward">
    Works alongside Cypress's `cy.intercept()` for browser-side mocks while Scenarist handles server-side scenarios.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Example API (Draft)

```typescript
// cypress/support/e2e.ts
import { withScenarios } from '@scenarist/cypress-helpers';
import { scenarios } from '../../lib/scenarios';

withScenarios(scenarios);

// cypress/e2e/checkout.cy.ts
describe('Checkout', () => {
  it('shows premium pricing for premium users', () => {
    cy.switchScenario('premium-user'); // Type-safe! Autocomplete works

    cy.visit('/checkout');
    cy.contains('Premium Plan').should('be.visible');
    cy.contains('$99.00').should('be.visible');
  });

  it('handles payment failure gracefully', () => {
    cy.switchScenario('payment-declined');

    cy.visit('/checkout');
    cy.get('[data-testid="pay-button"]').click();
    cy.contains('Payment declined').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

### Tell Us What You Need
