## Testing Remix with Scenarist

Scenarist addresses the testing challenges outlined in the [Remix documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/testing), which notes: *"There aren't standard ways of testing components that have Remix code."*

### The Challenge

Remix developers must test loaders and actions separately from components, then hope they integrate correctly. Traditional testing approaches force you to choose between:

- Unit testing loaders/actions in isolation (misses integration issues)
- Full E2E tests with browser automation (too slow for comprehensive coverage)
- Mocking Remix internals (creates distance from production)

### How Scenarist Helps

Scenarist enables testing Remix loaders and actions at the HTTP layer where they naturally integrate:

- Test loaders and actions with real HTTP requests
- Verify data flow from loader → component without mocking Remix internals
- Test action mutations with different external API responses
- Run parallel tests with different scenarios

## Remix Support

:::note[Coming Soon]
Full Remix support is currently in development. The adapter will support:

- Testing loaders with runtime scenario switching
- Testing actions with state capture and stateful mocks
- Testing resource routes
- Testing with Remix middleware and context
- Example applications demonstrating patterns

**Interested in Remix support?** [Open a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/citypaul/scenarist/discussions) to share your use case and help prioritize development.

## Getting Started

Documentation and examples for Remix will be added once the adapter is available.

In the meantime, explore how Scenarist works with similar frameworks:

- [Next.js →](/frameworks/nextjs) - Similar full-stack patterns
- [Express →](/frameworks/express) - HTTP-level testing concepts
