<h2 id="what-scenarist-offers">What Scenarist Offers</h2>
<p>Before diving into comparisons, here's what Scenarist brings to the table:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Test ID Isolation</strong> — Run hundreds of parallel tests with different scenarios against one server</li>
  <li><strong>Runtime Switching</strong> — Change scenarios mid-test without restarts (retry flows, error recovery)</li>
  <li><strong>First-Class Playwright</strong> — Dedicated fixtures with type-safe scenarios and automatic test ID isolation</li>
  <li><strong>Response Sequences</strong> — Built-in polling, retry flows, state machines</li>
  <li><strong>Stateful Mocks</strong> — Capture request values, inject into responses. State is isolated per test ID, so parallel tests never conflict</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Matching</strong> — Body, headers, query params, regex with specificity-based selection</li>
</ul>
